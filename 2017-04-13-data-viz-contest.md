Louisville R-User Group Open Data Visualization Contest
===

## Purpose

First and foremost - the purpose is to learn! We want folks to jump into R and mess around with its vast libraries that are useful for effective data visualization. This will be a great opportunity for us all to work together through the learning process as well, and will strengthen the local community of R fanatics.

Second, we want to develop strong partnerships within the data community. This is both our own local data folks (via the Civic Data Alliance and our local open data city gov't friends) as well as national (via Data.World). Access to data will always be one of the most important aspects of data analytics, so whatever we can do to promote data openness and develop against that is super important.

## Rules

There are only a handful of rules:

- You **must** use R for your final visualiation
- Your code must be open (at least the visualization part)
- Ideally, your final data set should be shareable on Data.World's platform on our Organization page

Beyond that, the sky's the limit! We would also like folks to try and utilize either the KY Legislature API built by the Civic Data Alliance, or any of the datasets stored on Louisville's Open Data Portal - but if contestants have their eye on a particular set of data that falls outside of those then that's OK by us.

## Submission and Judging

**Deadline**

Our next meet up is scheduled for May 23rd from 12 - 1:30pm where the winners will be announced. In order for us to have time to judge the submissions, please have your visualizations finalized and submitted by May 16th.

**How to Submit**

Think of this as somewhat open ended. We do ask that your source code be sent to us (either via email or on slack) so that we can host on our GitHub page, but the visual itself can either be any image file that is shared with us or a visualization that is hosted on a standalone page. Whatever suits your fancy - we just want to put eyes on it!

**Judges**

- Ben Reno-Webber - Project Director, Greater Louisville Project
- Michael Schnuerle - Chief Data Officer, City of Louisville
- Zain Khandwala - Executive Director, Institute for Advanced Analytics at Bellarmine University

## Prizes

Aside from the obvious bragging rights, the winner will receive a **swag pack** from our sponsors at Data.World. There will also be coverage of the contest and the final results on Data.World's social media accounts and website. So...there's that too.
